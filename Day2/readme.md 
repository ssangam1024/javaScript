HTML CSS review:

HTML Syntax Rules:

* HTML elements are used to create parts of a webpage.
* Most HTML elements have an opening tag <tag> and a closing tag </tag>.
* Nesting means placing one element inside another.
Web Page:
* A web page is a single page that is part of a website.

Css - CSS is like a set of instructions to style your HTML.

CSS Syntax Rules:

* CSS Selector: Selects which HTML elements you want to style (change how they look). Example: p, .class-name, #id-name

* CSS Style Rule: Tells the browser how to change the appearance of the selected element. In each style rule:
*      The left side is called the CSS property – it tells what you want to change. 
*       The right side is the CSS value – it tells how you want to change it. 


HTML Attributes – Syntax Rules:

* Attributes provide extra information about an HTML element.
* They are always written inside the opening tag of the element.
* The left side is called the attribute name (example: href, src, class)
* The right side is the attribute value

—>  class uses a dot (.) in CSS to style groups of elements.
—>  id uses a hash (#) to style one specific element.

Html Structure : 

<!DOCTYPE html> → Tells the browser: “Use the latest version of HTML (HTML5).”

<html>...</html> → Wraps the entire webpage. Everything goes inside this.

<head>...</head> → Contains info about the page, like:
* The page title (shown in the browser tab)
* Links to CSS files
* Meta tags (for SEO, responsive design, etc.)

<body>...</body> → Contains everything that is visible on the screen, like:
* Text
* Images
* Buttons
* Forms
* Links

1. Indents (Spaces in Front) -(make code look neat)
* Indents are spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line.
* They help make the code easier to read and understand.
2. Line Wrapping -(long code continues on the next line)
* When a line of code is too long, it moves to the next line automatically in the editor.
* This doesn't change how the code works — it's just for easier viewing.
3. Script Code (JavaScript) -(code that runs first)
* The code inside a <script> tag runs first when the page loads.
4. onclick Event - (code that runs when you click)
* The code in onclick runs later, only when the user clicks a button (or another element).
5. Comments - (notes for people, ignored by computer)
* Comments are pieces of code the computer ignores.
* We use them to:
    * Explain what the code is doing (for people reading it)
    * Temporarily hide code without deleting it
